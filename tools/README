A jar file that generates a valid NetCDF-3 file

To generate a file do the following:

ant jar
ant run

this will generate a .nc file with the timestamp, in milliseconds since the epoch, being the file name. This should allow using the file name to seed the random number generator as a means of checking the data somewhere down the line.
